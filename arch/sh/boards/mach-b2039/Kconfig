	prompt "B2039: card selection on CN14 connector (Ethernet PHY)"
	default STM_B2039_CN14_NONE
	help
	  Select the appropriate Ethernet PHY card.
	  This controls the Ethernet connection mode with the PHY, and
	  the corrisponding pad allocation and configuration.

config STM_B2039_CN14_NONE
       bool "None"
       help
         No Ethernet card is plugged into CN14 of the B2039.

config STM_B2039_CN14_B2032
	bool "B2032 IC+ IP1001 PHY card"
	help
	  B2032 Ethernet card on CN14 of B2039.

	  Note in order to continue using UART10 it will be necessary
	  to remove R256.

config STM_B2039_CN14_B2035
	bool "B2035 IC+ IP101 PHY card"
	help
	  B2035 connected to CN14 of B2039.

config STM_B2039_J35_PHY_RESET
	bool "Use PIO3[0] as a PHY reset signal"
	default y
	help
	  Set this option to use PIO3[0] as a PHY reset signal. This requires
	  fitting J35 in position 1-2 (which prevents the use of this pin
	  as SBC_SYS_CLK_IN), and also disconnecting CN12 (which prevents
	  the use of UART11). This also conflicts with the keyscan and
	  PWM10 use of this pin.
