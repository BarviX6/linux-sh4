	  Driver for the PIO pins on STMicroelectronics ST40 and ST200
	  based parts.

config STM_DMA
	bool "STMicroelectronics DMA API"
	depends on CPU_SUBTYPE_STB7100
	default y
	---help---
	  Selecting this option will provide support for STMicroelectronics'
	  custom DMA API. This API provides support for data transfers of
	  various dimensions and complex linked list operations. In addition
	  to these free-running operations it also allows management of the
	  paced-transfer peripherals on recent STM parts.

	  On STb7100 DMA support is vital for the correct operation of the
	  sound system.

	  If you have a device from STMicroelectronics, then say Y here.
	  Otherwise say N.

config MIN_STM_DMA_CHANNEL_NR

	  use with STM-DMA

config MAX_STM_DMA_CHANNEL_NR

        ---help---
        Many of the ST system-on-chip devices have multiple CPUs, where a
        master CPU running Linux has control over a number of slave CPUs,
        which are usually used to run dedicated algorithms.
        Enabling this option will add support to the Linux kernel to
        control these slave CPUs, reserve memory for them, and thus allow
        code to be downloaded onto them and executed.
        Adding in the command line the following string:
        coprocessor_mem=[offset]:size0[,size1][,size2]...
        where:
        offset defines where the co-processors region starts.
               It's an offset from ST40 RAM start.
        size{n} defines the region size for the n.th slave core (max 16M).

        Example: coprocessor_mem=32m:16m,16m

config  STM_COPROCESSOR
	bool "STM coprocessor support"
	help
	  Select this option to enable support for the slave coprocessors
	  found on many ST system-on-chip devices.
