menu "STM specific devices"
        depends on STM_DRIVERS

config STM_PIO
	tristate "STMicroelectronics PIO Support"
	depends on CPU_SUBTYPE_ST40
	default y
	help
	  Driver for the PIO pins on STMicroelectronics ST40 and ST200
	  based parts.

config STM_DMA
	bool "STMicroelectronics DMA API"
	depends on CPU_SUBTYPE_STB7100
	default y
	---help---
	  Selecting this option will provide support for STMicroelectronics'
	  custom DMA API. This API provides support for data transfers of
	  various dimensions and complex linked list operations. In addition
	  to these free-running operations it also allows management of the
	  paced-transfer peripherals on recent STM parts.

	  On STb7100 DMA support is vital for the correct operation of the
	  sound system.

	  If you have a device from STMicroelectronics, then say Y here.
	  Otherwise say N.

config MIN_STM_DMA_CHANNEL_NR
	depends on STM_DMA
	int "Lowest STM-FDMAC channel"
	default "0"
	help
	  This allows you to specify the low boundary FDMA channel number to
	  use with STM-DMA

config MAX_STM_DMA_CHANNEL_NR
	depends on STM_DMA
	int "Highest STM-FDMAC channel"
	default "15"
	help
	  This allows you to specify the high boundary FDMA channel number to
	  use with STM-DMA

	bool "STMicroelectronics DMA Debug"
	depends on STM_DMA
	default n
